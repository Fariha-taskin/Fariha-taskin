Hi, I am Fariha Taskin; currently working as a research Associate at Economic Research Platform (ERP), North South University.

Prior to that, I completed my BS and MS in Applied Statistics from ISRT, University of Dhaka (https://www.isrt.ac.bd/).

My research interest is in the following fields:

- Causal Inference

Fun fact: the world is all about diversity; even the quotes conflicts. One Example

"The Only Constant in Life Is Change."- Heraclitus

v/s

"Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose" - "The more things change, the more they stay the same" - Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr

A good statistician accepts the diversities and try to find the reason behind those.
